        <h3>This page will be an example of internal CSS </h3>
            <p>Internal CSS, also known as inline CSS, is a method for adding CSS styles directly to an HTML document, within the <head> section. It is a simple and convenient way to style individual HTML elements and apply specific styles to a single page without the need for separate CSS files.</p><br>

                The "Hello, World!" program is a classic rite of passage for programmers, often serving as the first program they write in a new language. It's a simple program that simply prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. While it may seem trivial, it's a crucial step in learning how to program, as it introduces the basics of syntax, output, and execution.<br><br>
                In the realm of web development, the "Hello, World!" program takes on a slightly different form. Instead of printing to the console, it displays the phrase "Hello, World!" on a webpage. This requires the use of HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web pages.<br><br>
                The simplicity of the "Hello, World!" program makes it a popular subject for memes among web developers. These memes often poke fun at the mundanity of writing the program or the sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully running it. They also highlight the challenges of web development, such as debugging and dealing with complex code. 
                <ol>
                    <Li>A meme featuring a picture of a computer scientist with a triumphant expression, accompanied by the text: "My first web dev project: I wrote a 'Hello, World!' website."</Li><br>
                    <li>A meme with the caption: "When you've been working on a complex web project for weeks and it finally works, but all you can do is print 'Hello, World!' to the page.</li><br>
                    <li>A meme depicting a web developer trying to debug a seemingly simple issue, with the text: "Me trying to figure out why my 'Hello, World!' website isn't displaying the correct text."</li><br>
                </ol>
                    These memes capture the essence of the "Hello, World!" program and its place in the web development journey. They serve as a reminder of the challenges and rewards of learning to code, and the sense of accomplishment that comes from mastering the basics.<br>
