            The "Hello, World!" program is a classic rite of passage for programmers, often serving as the first program they write in a new language. It's a simple program that simply prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. While it may seem trivial, it's a crucial step in learning how to program, as it introduces the basics of syntax, output, and execution.<br><br>
            In the realm of web development, the "Hello, World!" program takes on a slightly different form. Instead of printing to the console, it displays the phrase "Hello, World!" on a webpage. This requires the use of HTML and CSS, the building blocks of web pages.<br><br>
            The simplicity of the "Hello, World!" program makes it a popular subject for memes among web developers. These memes often poke fun at the mundanity of writing the program or the sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully running it. They also highlight the challenges of web development, such as debugging and dealing with complex code.
